 Computers are often used to store and efficiently use data.  In this project we implement a linked list as the
 primary data structure.  However, this linked list is implemented in a class.  This converts the Abstract data type
 to a higher level.  In other words, it hides some of the functionality to the user.

 This program creates Polynomials.  It is menu-driven, so user just needs to interact with the console.

 However, if you are interested in the infrastructure of the program, here is a synopsis:
 Class contains a lot of public functions, basic ones that one would expect to able to do with polynomials.
 The private members contain a pointer that points to the first term in the polynomial.  As well as other
 functions that are there because of reccursive means.  Standard insertion and extraction operators are
 overloaded to use string streams.  String streams are used to print out polynomials in a way that they would
 look in 'real' life.  Ex. + -1x^2 is simply -x^2.  Obvious operations one polynomials such as add,subtract, multiply
 etc. are added to the class functions.


 Type make clean, then ./run to run the program.
